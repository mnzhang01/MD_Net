This repository provides the code of the following paper: Self-supervised multi-scale neural network for blind deblurring(https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/ipi.2023046).

To train/test our paper, please run the *main.py*.

You can test this code on your own data. If the deblurring result is not as good as expected, please try more by changing the '*kernel_size*' and '*num_iter*'.

If you find our work useful for your research, please cite it:
